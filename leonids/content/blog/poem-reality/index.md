<p>
  We have to take good care of things<br>
  Tell yourself the truth and don't lie<br>
  If we just let those go by<br>
  There will be no attached strings<br>
</p>
<p>
  I won't repeat the same mistake<br>
  This thought alone make my head ache<br>
  Even tho it's happening all over again<br>
  Doing best to avoid that pain<br>
  There's no one but yourself to blame<br>
</p>
<p>
  Is it possible to get it right on the first time ?<br>
  This post it self has been rewritten at least ten times<br>
  How many mountains do we have to climb ?<br>
  To hear someone else say that you won't thrive<br>
  but even if you do<br>
  It was luck that struck you<br>
</p>
